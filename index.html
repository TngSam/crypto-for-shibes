      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Hey shibes! We already passed the 2 million mark. Our community is
        growing incredibly fast and there are many people who are completely new
        to cryptocurrencies as well as the stock market. So I decided to make
        some sort of cryptocurrency 101 for shibes:)
        <br /><br />
        I think everyone should be aware how the crypto works and not only
        crypto but the market overall. Always

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In a few words, I will try to compactly collect here all the information
        that I've learned in my 2,5 years of trading and analyzing crypto
        markets.

      <h2>Essentials</h2>
      <p>
        I think we'll start from the essentials. Like the price movement and why
        exactly price is moving. Traders buy and sell an asset every second. For
        example, you need to buy DOGE. First of all, you need to place an order
        to buy. You can choose at what price you want to buy it
        <i>(limit order)</i> and also you can buy it immediately at market price
        <i>(market order)</i>. Let's specify the price at which you want to buy
        DOGE, i.e. $0,35. You press the 'Buy' button and your order will be
        placed in the orderbook and it will be executed when the price will hit
        $0,35.<br /><i>What's an orderbook?</i> â€” To understand people's intentions
        there exist such a cool tool as an orderbook.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="orderbook.png" alt="Orderbook" />
        <figcaption>Orderbook (screenshot from Cryptowatch Desktop)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Let's break down what the orderbook consists of.<br />In the first column
        you can see the price at which orders are placed. Second column tells us
        how much DOGE people want to buy or sell at this price. And the third
        column shows the cumulative amount of orders placed. Cumulative means that
        orders at previous levels are summed up at each level. When the amount of
        DOGE at the level closest to the price decreases, it means that people
        are whether buying or canceling orders, and vice versa with selling.
        Simply put, it's called <i>absorbing</i>. <br /><br />
        Okay, we finished with the orderbook. Now let's take a look at OHLC
        chart.
      </p>
      <h3>What's the OHLC?</h3>
      <p>OHLC is standing for Open, High, Low and Close.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="candle.png" alt="Candlestick" />
        <figcaption>Candlestick chart (screenshot from TradingView)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        OHLC chart consists of these candles. Each candle have an abstract
        timeframe that you chose. For example, in this screenshot I used 4h
        timeframe so every candle closes every 4 hours. Each candle has: open
        price â€” the price at which candle was opened; high price shows the
        highest price in the particular timeframe; low price wick shows the
        lowest price; close price shows at which price candle was closed.
        Usually, if the candle body is green then close price is higher than
        open price, and if the candle body is red â€” vice versa.
        <br />
        New candle's open price is equal to previous candle close price.
      </p>
      <h3>Volume</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="volume.png" alt="Volume" />
        <figcaption>Volume (screenshot from TradingView)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        An important part in price analysis is volume. The volume shows the
        total amount of shares traded in particular timeframe. In most cases you
        can observe volume that was traded in each candle
        <i>(Open-High-Low-Close-Volume chart. OHLCV)</i>. <br /><br />
        Why it's important? Well, in a nutshell, if any every big move whether
        it's a bull run or correction is not backed up by increasing volume then
        there is a high probability that the market will go in reverse direction
        soon. A huge amount of the volume at the particular candle usually means
        that we're breaking some important price level so people are
        hyperactive.
      </p>

      <h2>Price action</h2>
      <p>
        Every asset has such a price action as growth and only up in big steps
        and suddenly price is starting to fall in bloody hell. These moves are
        called <i>"bull run"</i> and <i>"bear market"</i> accordingly. They have
        different names as well, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll call them
        like I said. Let's take a look at the recent DOGE price action.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="pa.png" alt="Price action" />
        <figcaption>DOGEUSDT, 4h timeframe</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Familiar structure, isn't it? DOGE performed +60% and then dropped -20%.
        Yes, that's exactly what I was talking about. We see a little bull run
        and a bit of correction. Why did I said little? Well, usually people say
        'bull run cycle has begun' and they mean global and larger timeframes
        (like months). Because the true bull run usually lasts months or
        sometimes even years, bear market too.
      </p>

      <h3>Support and resistance</h3>
      <p>
        Pretty interesting part because at this point you'll be able to make
        some price action predictions. Investors need to know where is the best
        place to buy so they won't sit HODLing in a swamp. Let's take a look at
        this <i>support</i> example.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="support.png" alt="Support" />
        <figcaption>Current DOGE support area</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        As you can see DOGE price touched this area almost
        <strong>5</strong> times! Sometimes we fell below tho but shibes
        defended it anyway and then we gone up!
        <i
          >When bears can't break the support more than <strong>3</strong> times
          then there is a high probability that bears are exhausting and the
          price will go up on the next touch. Same with resistance. But you
          can't be 100% sure! So firstly you need to confirm that bulls are here
          still to defend support area! Price should bounce again.</i

      <p>
        Thank you for reading! I hope that I helped you at least a bit with
        understanding how the market works. Maybe I will update it with new info
        soon and try to explain market cap, how to calculate price from it,
        technical analysis, etc. These are important parts too.
